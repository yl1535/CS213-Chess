# README
This is a code repository created solely for reading purposes, aimed to show some recorded works from part of a project, whose purpose is to create a simulated chess program.
Due to the failure of another programmer who works for building the front-end of this project, that is, the user's control page and display page of the chess program, this project remains half-finished till today.
The program can be normally compiled and executed in any basic java environment, and user can play the chess program by type in command in format "A B", where A is the starting location, and B is the ending location, such as "a2 a4".
